# Market Observations

The following observations are drawn from publicly available industry
reports, government publications, and EV market research.

These are not assumptions, but consistently reported market patterns.

---

## Electric Two-Wheeler Market

- Electric two-wheelers represent the fastest-growing segment of India’s EV market,
  driven by rising fuel costs, urban commuting needs, and improving battery economics.

- Tier-2 cities contribute a growing share of incremental E2W registrations,
  increasingly outpacing Tier-1 metros in year-on-year growth.

- Adoption in Tier-2 markets is concentrated in specific urban micro-markets
  rather than evenly distributed across cities.

---

## Customer Behaviour Patterns

- EV buyers increasingly prioritise reliability, service assurance and battery longevity
  over upfront purchase price.

- Income segments earning ₹30,000–₹80,000 per month demonstrate higher openness
  toward premium-priced electric two-wheelers.

- A significant portion of Tier-2 households own or intend to own a second vehicle,
  particularly for short-distance commuting.

- Students in education hubs exhibit higher early-adopter behaviour when charging
  access is available within campuses.

## City-Level Characteristics

- Cities with overlapping presence of:
  - educational institutions
  - industrial or IT employment clusters
  - organised residential development

  consistently show stronger EV adoption indicators.

- Tier classification alone does not fully explain EV readiness;
  functional city attributes matter more.

---

## Infrastructure Landscape

- Charging availability remains uneven, but adoption is materially higher
  in cities with concentrated charging corridors.

- Intercity travel corridors between major urban centres demonstrate
  higher EV movement density.

- Service accessibility is a stronger purchase driver than charging density alone.

These observations form the empirical foundation of the GTM strategy.
