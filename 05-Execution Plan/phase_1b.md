# Phase 1B — Tier-2 Expansion (Year 2)

## Strategic Objective

Scale horizontally within existing corridors after validating
operational readiness in Phase 1A.

---

## Expansion Approach

- Enter remaining Tier-2 cities within active clusters
- Expand only where logistics, training, and service bandwidth exist

No new region is entered without shared infrastructure support.

---

## Operational Scale-Up

- Hub-to-hub technician pooling
- Centralized spare-parts forecasting
- Regional training programs
- Mobile service fleet expansion

This creates resilience before geographic complexity increases.

---

## Marketing Focus

- referral-led acquisition
- customer advocacy programs
- society-level demos
- experience-led test ride events

Marketing shifts from awareness to credibility reinforcement.

---

## Charging Expansion

- densification within operational corridors
- emphasis on commuter routes
- society-level charging partnerships
- minimal highway dependency

---

## Outcome

- complete Tier-2 presence in priority regions
- improved unit economics
- consistent service experience across cities
- readiness for national scale
