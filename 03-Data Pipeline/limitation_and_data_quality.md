# Data Limitations and Interpretation Notes

## Known Data Limitations

While VAHAN provides the most comprehensive national registration dataset available, it has several inherent limitations:

- inconsistent city naming across states  
- missing registrations in certain RTOs  
- delayed reporting by regional authorities  
- absence of demographic buyer data  
- no distinction between private and fleet usage  

As a result, the dataset cannot be treated as a precise demand forecast.

## Interpretation Framework

The data was therefore used as:

- a directional indicator of EV concentration  
- a validation tool for market readiness  
- a supporting layer for strategic logic  

It was not used to:

- predict absolute market size  
- derive revenue estimates  
- rank cities purely by volume

## Role of Data in the Overall Strategy

Rather than allowing imperfect data to dictate strategy, the analysis followed a structured approach:

1. Establish market logic and behavioural drivers  
2. Identify structurally ready city archetypes  
3. Use VAHAN data to validate concentration patterns  
4. Align expansion sequencing with operational feasibility  

This ensured that data strengthened decision-making without overriding market realities.

## Key Takeaway

Public datasets in emerging markets are inherently noisy.

Robust go-to-market strategies therefore require:

- logic-led prioritisation  
- data-supported validation  
- operational realism  

This principle guided all subsequent strategy development.
