# Mother Hub Operating Model

## The Core Expansion Challenge

Premium electric two-wheeler expansion faces a fundamental constraint:

- opening full-scale showrooms and service centres in every city is capital intensive  
- dispersed infrastructure reduces service quality  
- overexpansion increases operational risk  
- excessive retail footprint dilutes premium brand perception  

At the same time, Tier-2 and Tier-3 demand cannot be addressed through online-only or partner-led models due to service dependency and trust requirements.

This necessitates a centralized but scalable operating structure.

## Definition of a Mother Hub

A mother hub is a company-owned, full-capability premium experience centre established in a strategically selected Tier-2 city.

Each mother hub functions as:

- a flagship experience centre  
- a regional service command centre  
- a spare-parts aggregation node  
- a logistics and technician base  

The hub is designed to serve not only the host city, but also surrounding Tier-3 towns within a defined operational radius.

## Core Capabilities of a Mother Hub

Each hub contains:

- premium showroom and experience zone  
- full-service workshop infrastructure  
- battery diagnostics and repair capability  
- trained technician pool  
- mobile service fleet deployment  
- spare part warehousing  

This enables consistent service quality without duplicating infrastructure across smaller cities.

## Hub-and-Spoke Radius Logic

Operational coverage is defined by a **100–150 km radius** from each mother hub.

Within this radius:

- customers are willing to travel for premium purchase experiences  
- mobile service vans can reach within acceptable SLA windows  
- charging partnerships can be deployed along transit corridors  

This mirrors premium automobile distribution behaviour, where customers routinely travel intercity for high-value purchases.

## Tier-3 Coverage Without Sales Points

Tier-3 cities are intentionally not equipped with permanent showrooms during early phases.

Instead, access is enabled through:

- purchase journeys anchored at mother hubs  
- mobile service support for breakdowns and routine maintenance  
- scheduled service camps conducted periodically  
- corridor charging infrastructure between towns and hubs  

This allows market reach without retail overextension.

---

## Premium Positioning Advantage

The mother hub model preserves premium positioning by:

- maintaining exclusive brand-controlled environments  
- avoiding mixed-brand retail exposure  
- concentrating experience quality rather than diluting it  
- reinforcing aspiration through flagship presence  

Customers seeking premium products demonstrate a willingness to travel when experience quality and service reliability are assured.

## Operational Benefits

This model delivers multiple advantages:

- lower capital expenditure per city  
- predictable service logistics  
- higher technician utilisation  
- faster learning loops  
- simplified inventory planning  

Operational scale is achieved through density, not footprint.

## Strategic Role in Phased Expansion

Mother hubs act as anchors for each expansion phase:

- Phase 1: establish hubs in priority Tier-2 cities  
- Phase 2: activate surrounding Tier-3 markets  
- Phase 3: introduce secondary hubs in high-performing Tier-3 cities  

This creates a natural progression from concentration to expansion.

## Strategic Summary

> The mother hub model allows the company to expand reach without expanding complexity.

By prioritising depth over breadth, the company achieves:

- controlled growth  
- consistent service experience  
- capital efficiency  
- preservation of premium brand equity  

This operating model forms the backbone of sustainable Tier-2 and Tier-3 expansion.
