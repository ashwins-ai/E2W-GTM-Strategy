# Metrics Framework

This framework defines how the go-to-market strategy is measured,
validated, and scaled across phases.

The objective is to ensure that expansion decisions are driven by
operational readiness and customer validation — not geographic ambition.

Metrics are structured to support:

- premium positioning protection
- disciplined capital deployment
- phased expansion control
- early risk detection

---

## 1. Market Validation Metrics

These metrics confirm whether a city or cluster demonstrates
sufficient demand readiness.

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Monthly booking volume | Early demand signal |
| Test ride to booking conversion | Purchase intent strength |
| Customer enquiry growth rate | Market awareness |
| Repeat showroom footfall | Brand traction |
| Average selling price (ASP) | Premium acceptance |

**Phase Gate Usage**

- Used to validate Tier-2 hub readiness before Tier-3 activation.
- Low ASP compression indicates premium positioning is intact.

---

## 2. Customer Quality Metrics

These metrics assess whether the correct customer segments are being acquired.

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Income-band mix (₹30k–₹80k) | Target segment validation |
| Second-vehicle buyer ratio | Premium behaviour indicator |
| Student conversion share | Campus strategy effectiveness |
| Financing penetration | Accessibility without discounting |
| Referral rate | Trust-based adoption |

**Interpretation**

- High referral and second-vehicle ratios indicate brand-led demand,
  not price-led adoption.

---

## 3. Operational Readiness Metrics

These metrics ensure scalability without service dilution.

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Average service response time | Ownership confidence |
| First-year breakdown incidents | Product reliability |
| Mobile service coverage radius | Tier-3 viability |
| Service technician utilization | Capacity planning |
| Spare parts fill rate | Supply chain readiness |

**Phase Gate Usage**

- Tier-3 expansion proceeds only when service SLA stability is achieved
  across Tier-2 hubs.

---

## 4. Charging & Infrastructure Metrics

These metrics validate range confidence and corridor viability.

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Charging point uptime | Reliability |
| Corridor charger density | Intercity confidence |
| Average charging wait time | Usability |
| Charging sessions per vehicle | Real usage |
| Partner charger coverage | Asset-light scalability |

**Interpretation**

- Adoption improves materially once corridor coverage exceeds threshold density.

---

## 5. Hub Performance Metrics (Mother Hub Model)

These metrics determine hub effectiveness as regional anchors.

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Hub throughput (monthly units) | Commercial viability |
| City catchment penetration | Regional influence |
| Tier-3 customer inflow | Spillover effectiveness |
| Test ride capacity utilization | Demand absorption |
| Service bay utilization | Infrastructure efficiency |

**Graduation Logic**

- High Tier-3 inflow validates hub-and-spoke expansion.

---

## 6. Financial Discipline Metrics

These ensure expansion does not compromise unit economics.

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Contribution margin per city | Sustainability |
| CAC to LTV ratio | Marketing efficiency |
| Payback period | Capital recovery |
| Fixed cost absorption | Hub scalability |
| Inventory turnover | Working capital health |

---

## 7. Brand Health Metrics

These protect long-term premium positioning.

| Metric | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | Trust indicator |
| Service satisfaction score | Ownership experience |
| Complaint closure TAT | Reliability perception |
| Social sentiment index | Brand narrative |
| Upgrade intent rate | Long-term loyalty |

---

## 8. Phase Progression Criteria

Expansion between phases occurs only when threshold conditions are met.

### Phase 1A → Phase 1B
- Stable monthly hub throughput
- Service SLA consistency
- Positive ASP stability
- Early Tier-3 inflow visible

### Phase 1B → Phase 2
- Multi-city operational repeatability
- Training scalability proven
- Supply chain stability achieved

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
- Tier-3 service economics validated
- Corridor charging maturity
- Mobile servicing cost efficiency

### Phase 3 → Phase 4 (Product Launch)
- Strong brand recall in Tier-2/3 markets
- Demonstrated premium trust
- Repeat purchase indicators
- Infrastructure maturity

---

## 9. Strategic Principle

> Expansion is not governed by city count,
> but by capability maturity.

Each phase is unlocked only when
operational, brand and customer metrics converge.

This ensures:

- premium positioning remains intact
- execution risk is contained
- scale is sustainable
- trust compounds before affordability

---

## Summary

This metrics framework transforms the GTM strategy from
a geographic rollout plan into a controlled operating system.

It enables:

- disciplined expansion
- early risk identification
- data-driven phase transitions
- long-term brand preservation

The strategy scales not because markets exist,
but because readiness is proven.
