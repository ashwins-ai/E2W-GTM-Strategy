# Risks and Mitigation Framework

The following table outlines key risks associated with mass-market expansion
and the mitigation mechanisms embedded within the proposed strategy.

---

## Strategic Risks

| Risk | Why It Matters | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|--------------------|
| Premium price resistance | Tier-2 markets are price sensitive | Target premium-yearning micro-segments rather than mass commuters |
| Brand dilution | Rapid expansion can weaken premium perception | Controlled hub-based rollout; no multi-brand dealerships |
| Overexpansion | High capex before demand validation | Strict phased entry with milestone-based progression |
| Product–market mismatch | One model may not suit all users | Delay mass product until brand trust is established |

## Operational Risks

| Risk | Why It Matters | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|--------------------|
| Service accessibility | Primary trust barrier outside metros | Mobile service vans + scheduled service camps |
| Charging anxiety | Direct adoption blocker | Corridor-based charging partnerships |
| Low initial throughput | New markets ramp slowly | Cluster launches instead of isolated cities |
| Talent scalability | Tier-2 service capability gaps | Centralised training through mother hubs |

## Market Risks

| Risk | Why It Matters | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|--------------------|
| Aggressive low-cost competitors | Price-led competition | Avoid price wars; compete on reliability and ownership experience |
| Consumer trust deficit | EV reliability concerns persist | First-year service assurance and extended warranties |
| Infrastructure delays | Charging rollout variability | Hybrid model combining private + partner charging |
| Demand concentration | Uneven city performance | Portfolio approach across clustered cities |

## Long-Term Risks

| Risk | Why It Matters | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|--------------------|
| Battery replacement economics | High replacement costs deter EVs | Long-term battery warranty and reliability messaging |
| Policy uncertainty | Subsidy volatility | Business model independent of incentives |
| Technology obsolescence | Rapid EV innovation cycles | Platform-driven modular product architecture |

This risk framework reinforces that the GTM strategy is designed not only
for growth, but for controlled, capital-efficient and brand-safe execution.
