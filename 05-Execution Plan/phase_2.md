# Phase 2 — North & East Expansion (Year 3)

## Strategic Objective

Replicate the validated operating model across new regions
while initiating Tier-3 demand activation.

---

## Implementation Model

- Direct replication of mother hub framework
- Limited city selection per corridor
- Shared training, inventory, and diagnostics systems

No experimentation with alternate models.

---

## Tier-3 Activation Strategy

Tier-3 cities are activated without permanent infrastructure through:

- mobile service vans
- scheduled service camps
- temporary experience events
- charging points along travel corridors

Tier-3 markets are treated as extensions, not standalone markets.

---

## Marketing Approach

- hub-led regional branding
- local influencer advocacy
- visibility at transit and commuting touchpoints
- service-first communication

---

## Outcome

- pan-India corridor presence
- Tier-3 interest validation
- minimal capex per new city
- maintained premium perception
