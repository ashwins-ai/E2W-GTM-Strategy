# Operating Assumptions

The following assumptions reflect variables outside direct company control.
They are required to enable strategic planning and execution modelling.

---

## Policy & Regulation

- No incremental EV subsidies specific to the company are assumed.
- Existing national and state EV policies remain broadly stable.

---

## Infrastructure Growth

- Public and private charging infrastructure continues to expand
  at a pace consistent with current policy direction.

- Highway charging coverage improves gradually but remains uneven.

---

## Market Dynamics

- Competitive intensity in Tier-2 cities remains fragmented
  during initial rollout years.

- No single competitor establishes dominant premium leadership
  in non-metro markets within the first three years.

---

## Consumer Behaviour

- EV awareness and acceptance continues to improve with
  visible product presence and peer adoption.

- Service experience remains a decisive factor in repeat purchases.

These assumptions define uncertainty boundaries rather than strategic beliefs.
