# Geographic Clustering & Hub Proximity Model

## Purpose of This Section

This section defines how Indian cities are clustered operationally
based on proximity to existing Tier-1 hubs.

Rather than treating Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities as independent markets,
the strategy adopts a **hub-and-spoke geography model**, ensuring:

- faster rollout
- lower logistics cost
- shared service infrastructure
- consistent customer experience

All expansion decisions are anchored to Tier-1 operational proximity.

## Core Tier-1 Anchor Hubs

The company’s existing operations and supply chain strengths are
concentrated around the following Tier-1 cities:

- **Bengaluru**
- **Chennai**
- **Mumbai**
- **Ahmedabad**
- **Delhi NCR**
- **Hyderabad**
- **Kolkata**

Each Tier-1 hub functions as:

- regional logistics origin
- technician training base
- spare-parts aggregation center
- escalation support node

---

# South–West–Central Corridor  
*(Phase 1 & Phase 2 Priority)*

This corridor is prioritised due to:

- dense road connectivity
- high inter-city travel frequency
- strong EV acceptance
- shorter service response distances
- mature supplier ecosystem

# Why Hub-Based Geography Matters

This clustering approach enables:

- shared technician pools  
- reduced spare-parts duplication  
- predictable service travel distances  
- faster response times  
- superior customer confidence  

A Tier-3 customer does not need a nearby showroom —
only reliable access to service and charging.

---

## Geographic Execution Principle

> **Cities do not scale independently — hubs do.**

All expansion decisions are therefore governed by:

- hub capacity
- road connectivity
- service response feasibility
- charging corridor availability

This ensures scale without chaos.

---

## Link to Execution Phases

| Phase | Geography Driven By |
|------|--------------------|
| Phase 1A | South & West Tier-2 anchors |
| Phase 1B | Corridor densification |
| Phase 2 | North & East Tier-2 entry |
| Phase 3 | Tier-3 hub adjacency |
| Phase 4 | National product expansion |
| Phase 5 | Ecosystem-wide coverage |

## Summary

Geography in this GTM strategy is not administrative.

It is **operational, service-driven, and experience-led**.

By anchoring growth around Tier-1 hubs, the company achieves:

- faster rollout  
- lower capex  
- superior reliability  
- preserved premium positioning  

before expanding nationwide.
