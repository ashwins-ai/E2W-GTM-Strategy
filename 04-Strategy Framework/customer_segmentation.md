# Customer Segmentation Framework

## Rethinking the “Mass Commuter” Segment

The mass commuter two-wheeler market in India is often treated as a single homogeneous segment driven primarily by affordability.

In reality, this market contains multiple income-based and behaviour-based subsegments with fundamentally different expectations around reliability, service quality, brand perception, and ownership experience.

A single pricing or product strategy cannot effectively serve all of them.

---

## Income-Based Segmentation

For strategic clarity, the mass commuter market can be segmented into three broad income cohorts:

### Segment A: ₹15,000–₹30,000 Monthly Income

Characteristics:

- extreme price sensitivity  
- purchase decisions driven by upfront cost  
- limited willingness to pay for brand or reliability  
- high dependence on low-cost petrol or entry-level EVs  

This segment prioritises affordability over long-term value.

**Strategic position:**  
Not a target segment in the initial phases.

Entering this cohort would require significant cost compromises and would dilute premium positioning.

---

### Segment B: ₹30,000–₹50,000 Monthly Income

Characteristics:

- salaried early-career professionals  
- daily commuting requirement  
- growing reliability consciousness  
- willingness to invest in durable assets  

This segment actively evaluates:

- service accessibility  
- long-term running cost  
- battery reliability  
- brand credibility  

They are typically underserved by low-quality EV offerings.

**Strategic position:**  
Primary target segment.

---

### Segment C: ₹50,000–₹80,000 Monthly Income

Characteristics:

- mid-career professionals and business owners  
- high brand awareness  
- ownership of at least one petrol vehicle  
- seeking a second mobility option  

Purchase drivers include:

- trust in product engineering  
- premium design and build  
- service assurance  
- perceived brand status  

**Strategic position:**  
Core premium commuter segment.

## Student Segment as a Distinct Adoption Driver

Students represent a structurally separate segment with unique characteristics:

- high daily commute frequency  
- limited public transport access in Tier-2 cities  
- strong environmental awareness  
- high peer influence  

Despite lower individual income, students exhibit:

- strong long-term brand loyalty  
- influence over household purchase decisions  
- high adoption openness when incentives are present  

Targeting students through structured institutional partnerships allows early penetration without price dilution.

## Why Tier-2 Demand Differs from Tier-1

In Tier-1 cities, EV adoption is often driven by:

- environmental signalling  
- technology novelty  
- government incentives  

In Tier-2 cities, adoption is driven by:

- reliability gaps in existing options  
- absence of dependable premium EV alternatives  
- growing aspiration for branded products  
- rising income stability  

This creates a **premium-yearning market** — consumers who may not demand luxury, but actively seek quality, trust, and longevity.

---

## Strategic Implication

The company’s expansion strategy therefore focuses on:

- excluding price-first buyers  
- prioritising reliability-seeking commuters  
- targeting aspirational consumers underserved by current EV offerings  
- leveraging students as early adoption multipliers  

This segmentation framework ensures that market entry expands demand **without compromising premium brand positioning**.
