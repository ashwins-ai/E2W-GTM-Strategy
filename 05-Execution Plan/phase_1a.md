# Phase 1A — Core Cluster Launch (Year 1)

## Strategic Objective

Build the foundation of the mass-market entry by establishing
high-visibility, high-trust operations in select Tier-2 anchor cities.

This phase focuses on **brand credibility, operational discipline,
and premium experience replication**.

---

## Geographic Focus

- Limited set of high-readiness Tier-2 cities
- Strong education density
- High proportion of salaried professionals
- Proximity to existing Tier-1 operational hubs

These cities function as long-term anchor points, not pilot markets.

---

## Operational Implementation

### 1. Premium Experience Hubs

Each city receives a company-owned experience hub designed to:

- replicate Tier-1 showroom standards
- offer full test-ride programs
- provide transparent pricing and financing
- deliver guided product education

The hub is positioned as a **brand destination**, not a retail outlet.

---

### 2. Mother Hub Model

Each Phase 1A city operates as a mother hub responsible for:

- complete service operations
- spare-parts warehousing
- diagnostics infrastructure
- technician training
- Tier-3 support within a ~100 km radius

This avoids early fragmentation of service quality.

---

### 3. Service Reliability Framework

- Dedicated service bays per hub
- 24-hour roadside assistance within hub radius
- Preventive maintenance scheduling
- Real-time service tracking via app

Trust in service reliability is prioritized over rapid sales growth.

---

## Charging Infrastructure Strategy

- Partnerships with private EV charging providers
- Chargers deployed at:
  - premium residential societies
  - tech parks and business districts
  - educational institutions
- Focus on visibility and reliability, not network scale

Charging placement follows commuter behavior, not map coverage.

---

## Marketing & Demand Activation

### Core Messaging

- reliability over experimentation
- ownership confidence
- premium engineering adapted for daily use

### Primary Channels

- campus collaborations
- residential society activations
- corporate commuter programs
- localized digital campaigns

Mass advertising is intentionally avoided.

---

## Success Metrics

- service turnaround time
- customer satisfaction scores
- referral-based leads
- charging uptime
- repeat engagement

Phase 1A is considered successful only when operational KPIs stabilize.

---

## Outcome

- trusted Tier-2 brand presence
- predictable service economics
- scalable hub blueprint
- foundation for controlled expansion
