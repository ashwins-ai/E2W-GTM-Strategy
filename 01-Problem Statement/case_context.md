# Problem Statement

## Company Background

The company is a leading electric two-wheeler (E2W) manufacturer in India, operating primarily in the premium segment. It has established strong brand recognition through differentiated product design, reliable performance, and a high-quality ownership experience.

To date, the company’s operations have been concentrated in Tier-1 metropolitan cities, where higher purchasing power, early EV adoption, and better charging infrastructure have supported premium pricing and controlled growth.

This focused approach has enabled profitability and brand strength but has inherently limited market scale.

## Market Context

India’s two-wheeler market is undergoing a structural transition toward electric mobility. Rising fuel prices, government incentives, and increasing environmental awareness have accelerated EV adoption across urban centres.

While initial growth was led by Tier-1 cities, recent adoption momentum has shifted toward Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, which together account for the majority of national two-wheeler demand.

These markets represent the next phase of volume growth for electric two-wheelers in India.

## Current Position

The mass commuter two-wheeler segment is characterised by:

- high price sensitivity  
- daily high-distance usage  
- strong dependence on financing  
- limited access to private charging infrastructure  
- deep loyalty to established petrol two-wheeler brands  

Most existing electric offerings in this segment compete primarily on affordability, often prioritising low upfront cost over long-term reliability, performance, or service experience.

As a result, premium electric two-wheelers remain underrepresented outside major metropolitan areas.

## Strategic Inflection Point

The company has reached a stage where future growth cannot be achieved solely through expansion within Tier-1 cities.

To unlock long-term scale, management has decided to enter the mass commuter segment and expand beyond its current geographic footprint.

However, this transition introduces significantly higher complexity, requiring:

- broader distribution reach  
- expanded service and after-sales infrastructure  
- new approaches to customer education and trust-building  
- operational readiness across diverse regional markets  

This marks a fundamental shift from the company’s existing operating model.

## Core Challenge

Management faces a critical trade-off:

- an aggressive nationwide expansion risks operational overload and brand dilution  
- a cautious, limited rollout risks losing early-mover advantage in rapidly evolving markets  

Additionally, Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities are not uniform in demand readiness, infrastructure maturity, or customer behaviour, making indiscriminate expansion both costly and risky.

The challenge therefore lies not in whether to expand, but **how to do so selectively and sustainably**.

---

## Decision Requirement

The company requires a clearly defined go-to-market strategy that:

- identifies which customer segments to prioritise  
- determines which geographies to enter first  
- outlines an appropriate distribution and service model  
- sequences expansion over a 3–5 year horizon  

The strategy must balance growth ambition with operational control, ensuring scalability without compromising long-term brand strength or execution reliability.
